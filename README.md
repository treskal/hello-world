Ironing out kinks in the brain

You see, it all started on that unassuming morning in July.
After getting out of bed that morning, looking out the window and not noticing anything out of the ordinary
I assumed it would be just another day.
Little did I know that by the time my head hits the pillow that night, myself and the world around me will have changed forever.

When I walked out the front door I saw a black SUV parked across the street.
